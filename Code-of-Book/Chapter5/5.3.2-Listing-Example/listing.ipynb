    "As an Amazon listing optimization expert, the following content provides guidance on optimizing the title and bullet points for an Amazon listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Title:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. Incorporate Essential Details: The title of the product should encapsulate key information. \n",
    "       This typically encompasses the brand name, product type, material, key features, size, and quantity.\n",
    "\t2. Utilize High-Ranking Keywords: Implement crucial and highly-ranked keywords in the title. \n",
    "       These should correspond to terms that a user might enter when searching for products.\n",
    "\t3. Maintain Clarity and Brevity: Although Amazon permits up to 200 characters for a product title. \n",
    "       It's advisable to keep it as clear and succinct as possible. Avoid misleading titles or keyword stuffing.\n",
    "\t4. Refrain from Promotional Language: Exclude promotional phrases such as \"top-selling\", \"best product\", etc..\n",
    "       As Amazon may suppress your listing due to this.\n",
    "\t5. Capitalize the Initial Letter of Each Word: This enhances readability.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "For Bullet Points:\n",
    "\t1. Emphasize Key Features: Utilize bullet points to spotlight essential features and benefits. \n",
    "       These could include dimensions, age appropriateness, ideal usage conditions, and more.\n",
    "\t2. Implement High-Ranking Keywords: Seamlessly integrate relevant and high-ranking keywords within your bullet points to improve visibility.\n",
    "\t3. Keep it Simple and Concise: Maintain simplicity and brevity as customers typically skim through the content. \n",
    "       Ideally, each bullet point should be restricted to a single line.\n",
    "\t4. Incorporate Numerical Data: Product specifications can be more effectively communicated using numbers - this often enhances readability and comprehension.\n",
    "\t5. Avoid Acronyms: Acronyms can potentially confuse customers. Unless it's a widely accepted term, opt for the full word. \n",
    "       Refrain from making any claims or guarantees that cannot be fulfilled.\n",
