# Make High Quality Dataset from WARC for Pre-training

In the following subsections, we will explain each step involved in generating High Qualit dataset Pre-training


## How to evaluate the quality of training data?

### Using a "clean" corpus and perplexity check
- Method: Train a model using a high-quality corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) and then use this model to check the perplexity of the new dataset.
- Advantages:
Quick: Can quickly assess the quality of the dataset.
Simple: Relatively simple to implement, does not require complex computational resources.
- Disadvantages:
Limitations: Low perplexity does not necessarily mean better performance on specific tasks.
Single Metric: Perplexity is just a single metric and cannot fully reflect the quality of the dataset.

### Training small models and testing on evaluation tasks
- Method: Extract a portion of data from the dataset, train a small model, and test the model's performance on a set of specific evaluation tasks (e.g., SQuAD, GLUE, etc.).
- Advantages:
Specific: Provides specific performance feedback by testing the model on actual tasks.
Diversity: Allows for the selection of various evaluation tasks to comprehensively assess the dataset quality.
- Disadvantages:
Resource Demand: Requires a certain amount of computational resources and time.
Task Selection: Needs to select diverse and representative evaluation tasks, which may increase complexity.

### Early signal method
- Method: Train a small model and conduct preliminary evaluations on some simple and quick benchmark tasks (e.g., text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.).
- Advantages:
Rapid Iteration: Quickly obtain initial feedback, facilitating rapid iteration and optimization.
Suitable for Early Stages: Helps quickly screen datasets in the early stages of development.
- Disadvantages:
Simple Tasks: These tasks may be relatively simple and may not fully represent the model's performance on complex tasks.
Preliminary Evaluation: Only provides initial performance feedback, which may require further detailed evaluation.

### Using GPT-4 for evaluation
- Method: Use the GPT-4 model to evaluate the new dataset, potentially including various tasks (e.g., text generation, question answering, sentiment analysis, etc.).
Advantages:
High-Quality Evaluation: As a powerful language model, GPT-4 can provide high-quality evaluation results, especially on complex tasks.
Multi-Task Capability: Can evaluate on various tasks, providing comprehensive performance feedback.
Real-World Usage: Evaluation results are closer to actual usage, especially if your final application is also based on similar advanced models.
- Disadvantages:
Computational Resources: Training and evaluating GPT-4 requires a large amount of computational resources and time, which may increase costs.
Complexity: The complexity of GPT-4 means more potential issues during debugging and optimization.
Overfitting Risk: If not careful, there is a risk of over-optimizing specific tasks, leading to poorer performance on other tasks.

### Summary
- Using a "clean" corpus and perplexity check: Suitable for quick, preliminary quality assessment but limited to a single metric.
- Training small models and testing on evaluation tasks: Suitable for scenarios requiring specific task performance feedback but requires more resources and task selection.
- Early signal method: Suitable for the early stages of development to quickly screen datasets but involves simpler tasks.
- Using GPT-4 for evaluation: Suitable for scenarios requiring high-quality and comprehensive evaluation, providing feedback closest to actual usage but with high resource demands.


## Prepare environment
In the following content, I will show how to create High Quality Dataset from WARC.

### Create conda env
```
#conda create --name=dataclean python=3.10  
#conda activate dataclean  
(dataclean) root@david1a100:~# cd dataclean/

(dataclean) root@david1a100:~/dataclean# hostname
david1a100.australiaeast.cloudapp.azure.com

#pip install datatrove xxhash faust-cchardet python-magic warcio fasteners tldextract trafilatura fasttext-wheel nltk awscli fasttext numpy==1.21.0  
#pip install datatrove[all]  
#pip install datatrove trafilatura awscli 
#aws configure  

```
### Download WARC
Access the following link to check WARC file address:
https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-23/index.html

Download this file named warc.paths.gz :

![images](https://github.com/xinyuwei-david/david-share/blob/master/Deep-Learning/Make-High-Quality-Dataset-From-WARC/images/1.png)


Check file path just as follwing in warc.paths.gz. There are so many warc.gz files, I only take CC-MAIN-20230527223515-20230528013515-00000.warc.gz as an example. 
```
crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-23/segments/1685224643388.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20230527223515-20230528013515-00000.warc.gz
```
Download files as follwing script:
```
(dataclean) root@david1a100:~/dataclean# cat download_warc_file.py
import os
import subprocess

def download_warc_file(url, output_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)

    print(f"Downloading {url}...")
    command = f"wget -P {output_dir} {url}"
    subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # URL of the WARC file
    warc_url = "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-23/segments/1685224643388.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20230527223515-20230528013515-00000.warc.gz"

    # output directory
    output_dir = "/root/dataclean/data/CC-MAIN-2023-23/segments"

    download_warc_file(warc_url, output_dir)
```
## Basic data processing
After download 00000.warc.gzÔºå I uses the local executor LocalPipelineExecutor to execute the data processing pipeline, which includes the following steps: 
- reading WARC files
- filtering URLs
- extracting content using Trafilatura
- filtering non-English content
- filtering duplicate content
- filtering low-quality content
- writing the processed data to JSONL files.

## Minhash deduplication

I use the local executor `LocalPipelineExecutor` to execute the data deduplication pipeline, which includes the following steps:

- **Configuring Minhash**: Setting up Minhash with 64-bit hashes for better precision and fewer false positives (collisions).

- **Reading Input Data**: Using `JsonlReader` to read input data from a specified directory.

- Stage 1: Calculating Minhash Signatures:

  - **Pipeline**: Reads input data and calculates Minhash signatures.
  - **Output**: Stores signatures in a specified folder.
  - **Tasks**: Configured to run with a specified number of tasks based on the local environment.

- Stage 2: Finding Matches Between Signatures in Each Bucket :

  - **Pipeline**: Processes the signatures to find matches within each bucket.
  - **Output**: Stores bucketed signatures in a specified folder.
  - **Tasks**: Runs with a number of tasks equal to the number of buckets.
  - **Dependency**: Depends on the completion of Stage 1.

- Stage 3: Creating Clusters of Duplicates:

  - **Pipeline**: Uses the results from all buckets to create clusters of duplicate items.
  - **Output**: Stores IDs of items to be removed in a specified folder.
  - **Tasks**: Runs as a single task.
  - **Dependency**: Depends on the completion of Stage 2.

- Stage 4: Filtering Out Duplicates:

  - **Pipeline**: Reads the original input data, counts tokens, filters out duplicates (keeping only one sample per cluster), and writes the deduplicated data to JSONL files.
  - **Output**: Stores deduplicated output and removed items in specified folders.
  - **Tasks**: Configured to run with a specified number of tasks.
  - **Dependency**: Depends on the completion of Stage 3.

## Sentence deduplication

My code uses the local executor `LocalPipelineExecutor` to execute the data deduplication pipeline, which includes the following steps:

- **Configuring Sentence Deduplication**: Setting up sentence deduplication with specific configurations such as the number of sentences, splitting sentences, and minimum document words.

- **Preprocessing Data**: Using NLTK to download the Punkt tokenizer and preprocess data before starting multiprocessing.

- **Reading Input Data**: Using `JsonlReader` to read input data from a specified directory.

- Stage 1: Extracting and Filtering Content:

  - **Pipeline**: Reads input data, extracts content using Trafilatura, filters based on quality and language, and writes intermediate results to JSONL files.
  - **Output**: Stores intermediate results in a specified folder.
  - **Tasks**: Configured to run with a specified number of tasks.

- Stage 2: Calculating Sentence Deduplication Signatures:

  - **Pipeline**: Processes the intermediate results to calculate sentence deduplication signatures.
  - **Output**: Stores signatures in a specified folder.
  - **Tasks**: Runs with a number of tasks equal to the number of finder workers.

- Stage 3: Finding and Filtering Duplicates:

  - **Pipeline**: Reads the intermediate results, finds duplicates using the calculated signatures, and filters out duplicates (keeping only one sample per cluster).

  - **Output**: Stores deduplicated output in a specified folder.

  - **Tasks**: Configured to run with a specified number of tasks.

    The pipeline is executed by running `executor_1.run()`, `executor_2.run()`, and `executor_3.run()`.
