States are responsible for \\nresponding to wildfires that begin o n nonfederal (state, \\nlocal, and private) lands, except for lands protected by \\nfederal agencies under cooperative agreements. The federal \\ngovernment is responsible for responding to wildfires that \\nbegin on federal lands.

The Department of the \\nInterior (DOI) manages wildfire response for more than 400 \\nmillion acres of national parks, w ildlife refuges and \\npreserves, other public lands, and Indian reservations.  \\nWildfire statistics help illustrate past U.S. wildfire activity. \\nNationwide data compiled by the National Interagency \\nCoordination  Center (NI CC) indicate that the number of \\nannual wildfires is variable but has decreased slightly  over \\nthe last 30 years . The number of acres affected  annually , \\nwhile also variable,  generally has increased (see  Figure 1). \\nSince 2000, an annual average of 7 0,025 wildfires have \\nburned an annual average of 7.0 million acres.  The acreage \\nfigure is more than  double the average annual acreage \\nburned in the 1990s (3. 3 million acres), although a greater \\nnumber of fires occurred annually in the 1990s on average \\n(78,600).  \\nTable 1.

In 202 2, 68,988 wildfires burned 7.6 \\nmillion acres . Over 40% of those acres were in Alaska (3.1 \\nmillion acres) .  \\nAs of June 1 , 202 3, around 18,300 wildfires have impacted  \\nover 511,000  acres  this year .  \\nFigure 2.

These numbers  may \\nnot be indicative of fire’s  impact on human development or \\ncommunities , since many fires occur in large, relatively \\nundeveloped areas . Acreage burned also does not in dicate \\nthe severity of a wildfire , the degree of impact upon forest s \\nor soils, or other ecological effects .  \\nMost wildfires are human -caused (89% of the average \\nnumber of wildfires from 201 8 to 202 2). Wildfires caused \\nby lightning tend to be slightly larger and  to burn more \\nacreage (5 3% of the average acreage burned from 201 8 to \\n2022) than human -caused fires .',\n",
       "   'Wildfire Statistics  \\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov  In 2022, 52% of the nationwide acreage burned by wildfires \\nwas on federal lands ( 4.0 million acres ; see Table 1), lower \\nthan the 10 -year average (64%) of impacted federal land \\nacreage. The other 48% of the acreage burned in 2022 was \\non state, local, or privately owned lands , though the f ires on \\nthese lands  accounted for 83% of total fires. Of the federal \\nacreage burned nationwide in 2022, 52% (2.1 million acres)  \\nburned on DOI land and 47% (1.9 million acres) burned on \\nFS land ( see Figure 3). The 2022 figures are driven largely \\nby Alaska, where just over half of the acreage impacted \\noccurred on nonfederal lands (1.6 million acres) and  just \\nunder half was on DOI lands (1.5 million acres).  \\nFigure 3. Percent age Acreage Burned by Owner ship \\n \\nSource:  NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports . \\nNote: DOI = Department of the Interior.  \\nMore wildfires occur in the East (including the central \\nstates), but the wildfires in the West (i.e., Alaska, Arizona, \\nCalifornia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, \\nNevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) are \\nlarger and burn more acreage. In 2022, just over  20,000 \\nwildfires burned approximately 5.8 million acres in the \\nWest, compared with the over  48,000 fires that burned  just \\nover 1.8 million acres in the East. In the East (where there \\nis less federal acreage), most of the fires occur on \\nnonfederal lands;  in the West , most of the fires occur on \\nfederal lands (see  Figure 4). In 20 22, 85% (1.5 million \\nacres ) of the  acreage burned in the East was on nonfederal \\nland, whereas  64% (3.7 million acres ) of the  acreage burned \\nin the West was on federal land.  \\nFigure 4. Acreage Burned by Region and Ownership  \\n \\nSource: NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports . \\nNotes:  West: AK, AZ, CA, CO, ID, HI, MT, NM, NV, OR, UT, WA , \\nand WY. East: All other states  and Puerto Rico.  Resources  \\nAnother metric useful for assessing wildfire activity is the \\nextent to which nationwide resources —including personnel  \\nand equipment —are engaged in  wildfire suppression . A \\nproxy for resource commitments is the nationwide \\nPreparedness Level  (PL) scale, which  ranges from 1 \\n(lowest) to 5 (highest). The higher PLs indicate significant \\ncommitment of shared resources. In 2022, the nationwide \\nlevel was 4 for 10 days and never reached the highest level \\n(5). In contrast, t he highest level was reached for  68 days  in \\n2021, the longest since at least 2000.  \\nWildfire Damages  \\nWildfires may affect  certain ecological resources  \\nbeneficially , but wildfires also may have devastating \\nimpact s, especially for communities affected by wildfire \\nactivity. Statistics showing the level of destruction a  \\nwildfire cause d can provide useful  metrics  to evaluate the \\nfire’s effect . Such statistics may include  acres burned  or \\nimpacted , lives lost (firefighte rs and civilians), and \\nstructures (residential, commercial, and other) destroyed.  \\nFor example, i n 202 2, over 2,700  struc tures were burned in \\nwildfires; the majority of the damage  occurred in California  \\n(see Table 2).   \\nTable 2. Loss Statistics  \\n 2019  2020  2021  2022  \\nStructures Burned  963 17,904  5,972  2,717  \\n% Residences  46% 54% 60% 46% \\nSource:  NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports .   \\nConflagrations  \\nOf the 1 .6 million wildfires that have occurred since 2000 , \\n254 exceeded 100,000 acres  burned  and 1 6 exceeded \\n500,000 acres  burned . A small fraction of wildfires become \\ncatastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for \\nthe vast majority of acres burned. For example, about 1% of \\nwildfires become conflagrations —raging, destructive \\nfires—but predicting which fires will “blow up” i nto \\nconflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of \\nfactors, such as weather and geography. There have been \\n1,041 large or significant fires annually on average from \\n2018 through 2022. In 2022, 2% of wildfires were \\nclassified as large or signif icant ( 1,289 ); 45 exceeded \\n40,000 acres in size , and 17 exceeded 100,000 acres. For \\ncontext, t here were fewer  large or significant wildfires in \\n2021 (943) but more in 201 7 (1,409).  \\nIssues for Congress  \\nIssues Congress  may consider  include the strategies an d \\nresources used for wildfire prevention, mitigation, and \\nmanagement , as well as  wildfires’ impact on both the \\nquality of life and the econom ies of communities affected \\nby wildfire activity. Other issues relate to post -wildfire \\nrecovery and site restoration. Congress also considers the \\ntotal federal cost of wildfire management, including the  \\ncost of suppression operations; these  costs vary annually  \\nand are difficult to predict .  \\nKatie Hoover , Specialist in Natural Resources Policy    \\nLaura A.

These numbers  may \\nnot be indicative of fire’s  impact on human development or \\ncommunities , since many fires occur in large, relatively \\nundeveloped areas . Acreage burned also does not in dicate \\nthe severity of a wildfire , the degree of impact upon forest s \\nor soils, or other ecological effects .  \\nMost wildfires are human -caused (89% of the average \\nnumber of wildfires from 201 8 to 202 2). Wildfires caused \\nby lightning tend to be slightly larger and  to burn more \\nacreage (5 3% of the average acreage burned from 201 8 to \\n2022) than human -caused fires .Wildfire Statistics  \\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov  In 2022, 52% of the nationwide acreage burned by wildfires \\nwas on federal lands ( 4.0 million acres ; see Table 1), lower \\nthan the 10 -year average (64%) of impacted federal land \\nacreage. The other 48% of the acreage burned in 2022 was \\non state, local, or privately owned lands , though the f ires on \\nthese lands  accounted for 83% of total fires. Of the federal \\nacreage burned nationwide in 2022, 52% (2.1 million acres)  \\nburned on DOI land and 47% (1.9 million acres) burned on \\nFS land ( see Figure 3). The 2022 figures are driven largely \\nby Alaska, where just over half of the acreage impacted \\noccurred on nonfederal lands (1.6 million acres) and  just \\nunder half was on DOI lands (1.5 million acres).  \\nFigure 3. Percent age Acreage Burned by Owner ship \\n \\nSource:  NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports . \\nNote: DOI = Department of the Interior.  \\nMore wildfires occur in the East (including the central \\nstates), but the wildfires in the West (i.e., Alaska, Arizona, \\nCalifornia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, \\nNevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) are \\nlarger and burn more acreage. In 2022, just over  20,000 \\nwildfires burned approximately 5.8 million acres in the \\nWest, compared with the over  48,000 fires that burned  just \\nover 1.8 million acres in the East. In the East (where there \\nis less federal acreage), most of the fires occur on \\nnonfederal lands;  in the West , most of the fires occur on \\nfederal lands (see  Figure 4). In 20 22, 85% (1.5 million \\nacres ) of the  acreage burned in the East was on nonfederal \\nland, whereas  64% (3.7 million acres ) of the  acreage burned \\nin the West was on federal land.  \\nFigure 4.

East: All other states  and Puerto Rico.  Resources  \\nAnother metric useful for assessing wildfire activity is the \\nextent to which nationwide resources —including personnel  \\nand equipment —are engaged in  wildfire suppression . A \\nproxy for resource commitments is the nationwide \\nPreparedness Level  (PL) scale, which  ranges from 1 \\n(lowest) to 5 (highest). The higher PLs indicate significant \\ncommitment of shared resources. In 2022, the nationwide \\nlevel was 4 for 10 days and never reached the highest level \\n(5). In contrast, t he highest level was reached for  68 days  in \\n2021, the longest since at least 2000.  \\nWildfire Damages  \\nWildfires may affect  certain ecological resources  \\nbeneficially , but wildfires also may have devastating \\nimpact s, especially for communities affected by wildfire \\nactivity. Statistics showing the level of destruction a  \\nwildfire cause d can provide useful  metrics  to evaluate the \\nfire’s effect . Such statistics may include  acres burned  or \\nimpacted , lives lost (firefighte rs and civilians), and \\nstructures (residential, commercial, and other) destroyed.  \\nFor example, i n 202 2, over 2,700  struc tures were burned in \\nwildfires; the majority of the damage  occurred in California  \\n(see Table 2).   \\nTable 2.

A small fraction of wildfires become \\ncatastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for \\nthe vast majority of acres burned. For example, about 1% of \\nwildfires become conflagrations —raging, destructive \\nfires—but predicting which fires will “blow up” i nto \\nconflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of \\nfactors, such as weather and geography.

Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\n\\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov  \\nUpdated June 1, 2023\\nWildfire Statistics\\nWildfires are unplanned fires, including lightning -caused \\nfires, unauthorized human -caused fires, and escaped fires \\nfrom prescribed burn projects. States are responsible for \\nresponding to wildfires that begin o n nonfederal (state, \\nlocal, and private) lands, except for lands protected by \\nfederal agencies under cooperative agreements. The federal \\ngovernment is responsible for responding to wildfires that \\nbegin on federal lands. The Forest Service (FS) —within the \\nU.S. Department of Agriculture —carries out wildfire \\nmanagement and response across the 193 million acres of \\nthe National Forest System  (NFS) . The Department of the \\nInterior (DOI) manages wildfire response for more than 400 \\nmillion acres of national parks, w ildlife refuges and \\npreserves, other public lands, and Indian reservations.  \\nWildfire statistics help illustrate past U.S. wildfire activity. \\nNationwide data compiled by the National Interagency \\nCoordination  Center (NI CC) indicate that the number of \\nannual wildfires is variable but has decreased slightly  over \\nthe last 30 years . The number of acres affected  annually , \\nwhile also variable,  generally has increased (see  Figure 1). \\nSince 2000, an annual average of 7 0,025 wildfires have \\nburned an annual average of 7.0 million acres.  The acreage \\nfigure is more than  double the average annual acreage \\nburned in the 1990s (3. 3 million acres), although a greater \\nnumber of fires occurred annually in the 1990s on average \\n(78,600).  \\nTable 1.

In 202 2, 68,988 wildfires burned 7.6 \\nmillion acres . Over 40% of those acres were in Alaska (3.1 \\nmillion acres) .  \\nAs of June 1 , 202 3, around 18,300 wildfires have impacted  \\nover 511,000  acres  this year .  \\nFigure 2.

These numbers  may \\nnot be indicative of fire’s  impact on human development or \\ncommunities , since many fires occur in large, relatively \\nundeveloped areas . Acreage burned also does not in dicate \\nthe severity of a wildfire , the degree of impact upon forest s \\nor soils, or other ecological effects .  \\nMost wildfires are human -caused (89% of the average \\nnumber of wildfires from 201 8 to 202 2). Wildfires caused \\nby lightning tend to be slightly larger and  to burn more \\nacreage (5 3% of the average acreage burned from 201 8 to \\n2022) than human -caused fires .Wildfire Statistics  \\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov  In 2022, 52% of the nationwide acreage burned by wildfires \\nwas on federal lands ( 4.0 million acres ; see Table 1), lower \\nthan the 10 -year average (64%) of impacted federal land \\nacreage. The other 48% of the acreage burned in 2022 was \\non state, local, or privately owned lands , though the f ires on \\nthese lands  accounted for 83% of total fires. Of the federal \\nacreage burned nationwide in 2022, 52% (2.1 million acres)  \\nburned on DOI land and 47% (1.9 million acres) burned on \\nFS land ( see Figure 3). The 2022 figures are driven largely \\nby Alaska, where just over half of the acreage impacted \\noccurred on nonfederal lands (1.6 million acres) and  just \\nunder half was on DOI lands (1.5 million acres).  \\nFigure 3. Percent age Acreage Burned by Owner ship \\n \\nSource:  NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports . \\nNote: DOI = Department of the Interior.  \\nMore wildfires occur in the East (including the central \\nstates), but the wildfires in the West (i.e., Alaska, Arizona, \\nCalifornia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, \\nNevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) are \\nlarger and burn more acreage. In 2022, just over  20,000 \\nwildfires burned approximately 5.8 million acres in the \\nWest, compared with the over  48,000 fires that burned  just \\nover 1.8 million acres in the East. In the East (where there \\nis less federal acreage), most of the fires occur on \\nnonfederal lands;  in the West , most of the fires occur on \\nfederal lands (see  Figure 4). In 20 22, 85% (1.5 million \\nacres ) of the  acreage burned in the East was on nonfederal \\nland, whereas  64% (3.7 million acres ) of the  acreage burned \\nin the West was on federal land.  \\nFigure 4. Acreage Burned by Region and Ownership  \\n \\nSource: NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports . \\nNotes:  West: AK, AZ, CA, CO, ID, HI, MT, NM, NV, OR, UT, WA , \\nand WY. East: All other states  and Puerto Rico.  Resources  \\nAnother metric useful for assessing wildfire activity is the \\nextent to which nationwide resources —including personnel  \\nand equipment —are engaged in  wildfire suppression . A \\nproxy for resource commitments is the nationwide \\nPreparedness Level  (PL) scale, which  ranges from 1 \\n(lowest) to 5 (highest). The higher PLs indicate significant \\ncommitment of shared resources. In 2022, the nationwide \\nlevel was 4 for 10 days and never reached the highest level \\n(5). In contrast, t he highest level was reached for  68 days  in \\n2021, the longest since at least 2000.  \\nWildfire Damages  \\nWildfires may affect  certain ecological resources  \\nbeneficially , but wildfires also may have devastating \\nimpact s, especially for communities affected by wildfire \\nactivity. Statistics showing the level of destruction a  \\nwildfire cause d can provide useful  metrics  to evaluate the \\nfire’s effect . Such statistics may include  acres burned  or \\nimpacted , lives lost (firefighte rs and civilians), and \\nstructures (residential, commercial, and other) destroyed.  \\nFor example, i n 202 2, over 2,700  struc tures were burned in \\nwildfires; the majority of the damage  occurred in California  \\n(see Table 2).   \\nTable 2. Loss Statistics  \\n 2019  2020  2021  2022  \\nStructures Burned  963 17,904  5,972  2,717  \\n% Residences  46% 54% 60% 46% \\nSource:  NICC  Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports .   \\nConflagrations  \\nOf the 1 .6 million wildfires that have occurred since 2000 , \\n254 exceeded 100,000 acres  burned  and 1 6 exceeded \\n500,000 acres  burned . A small fraction of wildfires become \\ncatastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for \\nthe vast majority of acres burned. For example, about 1% of \\nwildfires become conflagrations —raging, destructive \\nfires—but predicting which fires will “blow up” i nto \\nconflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of \\nfactors, such as weather and geography. There have been \\n1,041 large or significant fires annually on average from \\n2018 through 2022. In 2022, 2% of wildfires were \\nclassified as large or signif icant ( 1,289 ); 45 exceeded \\n40,000 acres in size , and 17 exceeded 100,000 acres. For \\ncontext, t here were fewer  large or significant wildfires in \\n2021 (943) but more in 201 7 (1,409).  \\nIssues for Congress  \\nIssues Congress  may consider  include the strategies an d \\nresources used for wildfire prevention, mitigation, and \\nmanagement , as well as  wildfires’ impact on both the \\nquality of life and the econom ies of communities affected \\nby wildfire activity. Other issues relate to post -wildfire \\nrecovery and site restoration. Congress also considers the \\ntotal federal cost of wildfire management, including the  \\ncost of suppression operations; these  costs vary annually  \\nand are difficult to predict .  \\nKatie Hoover , Specialist in Natural Resources Policy    \\nLaura A.

In 20 22, 85% (1.5 million \\nacres ) of the  acreage burned in the East was on nonfederal \\nland, whereas  64% (3.7 million acres ) of the  acreage burned \\nin the West was on federal land.  \\nFigure 4.
