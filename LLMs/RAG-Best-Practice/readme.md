# RAG-Best-Practice

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval. It enhances the model's capabilities by retrieving and utilizing relevant information from external knowledge bases during the generation process. This provides the model with up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge, enabling it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Purpose of RAG

**Why do we need RAG?**

- **Reducing Hallucinations**: LLMs may produce inaccurate or false information, known as "hallucinations," when they lack sufficient context. RAG reduces the occurrence of hallucinations by providing real-time external information.

- **Updating Knowledge**: The pre-training data of LLMs may lag behind current information. RAG allows models to access the latest data sources, maintaining the timeliness of information.

- **Enhancing Accuracy**: By retrieving relevant background information, the model's answers become more accurate and professional.

  

### How RAG Works

The core idea of RAG is to retrieve relevant information from a document repository and input it into the LLM along with the user's query, guiding the model to generate a more accurate answer. The general process is as follows:

- **User Query**: The user poses a question or request to the system.
- **Retrieval Phase**: The system uses the query to retrieve relevant document fragments (chunks) from a document repository or knowledge base.
- **Generation Phase**: The retrieved document fragments are input into the LLM along with the original query to generate the final answer.


### Key Steps to Building a RAG System

### Clarify Objectives

Before starting to build a RAG system, you need to first clarify your goals:

- **Upgrade Search Interface**: Do you want to add semantic search capabilities to your existing search interface?

- **Enhance Domain Knowledge**: Do you wish to utilize domain-specific knowledge to enhance search or chat functions?

- **Add a Chatbot**: Do you want to add a chatbot to interact with customers?

- **Expose Internal APIs**: Do you plan to expose internal APIs through user dialogues?

  Clear objectives will guide the entire implementation process and help you choose the most suitable technologies and strategies.

### Data Preparation

Data is the foundation of a RAG system, and its quality directly affects system performance. Data preparation includes the following steps:

**(1) Assess Data Formats**

- **Structured Data**: Such as CSV, JSON, etc., which need to be converted into text format to facilitate indexing and retrieval.

- **Tabular Data**: May need to be converted or enriched to support more complex searches or interactions.

- **Text Data**: Such as documents, articles, chat records, etc., which may need to be organized or filtered.

- **Image Data**: Including flowcharts, documents, photographs, and similar images.

  

  **(2) Data Enrichment**

- **Add Contextual Information**: Supplement data with additional textual content, such as knowledge bases or industry information.

- **Data Annotation**: Label key entities, concepts, and relationships to enhance the model's understanding capabilities.

  

  **(3) Choose the Right Platform**

- **Vector Databases**: Such as AI Search, Qdrant, etc., used for storing and retrieving embedding vectors.

- **Relational Databases**: The database schema needs to be included in the LLM's prompts to translate user requests into SQL queries.

- **Text Search Engines**: Like AI Search, Elasticsearch, Couchbase, which can be combined with vector search to leverage both text and semantic search advantages.

- **Graph Databases**: Build knowledge graphs to utilize the connections and semantic relationships between nodes.

## Document Chunking

In a RAG system, document chunking is a critical step that directly affects the quality and relevance of the retrieved information. Below are the best practices for chunking:

- Model Limitations: LLMs have a maximum context length limitation.
- Improve Retrieval Efficiency: Splitting large documents into smaller chunks helps to improve retrieval accuracy and speed.



**Methods to do chunking**

- **Fixed-Size Chunking**: Define a fixed size (e.g., 200 words) for chunks and allow a certain degree of overlap (e.g., 10-15%).
- **Content-Based Variable-Size Chunking**: Chunk based on content features (such as sentences, paragraphs, Markdown structures).
- **Custom or Iterative Chunking Strategies**: Combine fixed-size and variable-size methods and adjust according to specific needs.

**Importance of Content Overlap**

- **Preserve Context**: Allowing some overlap between chunks during chunking helps to retain contextual information.
- **Recommendation**: Start with about 10% overlap and adjust based on specific data types and use cases.



## Choosing the Right Embedding Model

Embedding models are used to convert text into vector form to facilitate similarity computation. When choosing an embedding model, consider:

- **Model Input Limitations**: Ensure the input text length is within the model's allowable range.

- **Model Performance and Effectiveness**: Choose a model with good performance and suitable effectiveness based on the specific application scenario.

## Service Capacity and Performance Optimization

**(1) Service Tiers and Capacity**

- **Service Tiers**: For example, Azure AI Search's Standard S1 and S2 tiers offer different performance levels and storage capacities.

- **Replicas and Partitions**: Increasing replicas improves query throughput; increasing partitions enhances index capacity and query performance.

  **(2) Performance Optimization Tips**

- **Upgrade Service Tier**: Upgrading from Standard S1 to S2 can provide higher performance and storage capacity.

- **Increase Partitions and Replicas**: Adjust based on query load and index size.

- **Avoid Complex Queries**: Reduce the use of high-overhead queries, such as regular expression queries.

- **Query Optimization**: Retrieve only the required fields, limit the amount of data returned, and use search functions rather than complex filters.


**III. Prompt Engineering**

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to guide the model in generating the desired responses. By carefully crafting precise and clear instructions, you can steer the model to produce accurate and relevant outputs.

1. **Components of a Prompt**

- **Instruction**: Clearly tells the model what task needs to be performed.
- **Context**: Provides additional information or scenarios to help the model understand the task.
- **Input Data**: The specific data or question that needs to be processed.
- **Output Indicator**: The expected output type or format.

1. **Example of Prompt Engineering**

   **Example 1: Generating an Elasticsearch DSL Query**

   Your task is to construct a valid Elasticsearch DSL query.

   Based on the mapping provided between three backticks `{mapping}`, convert the text delimited by triple quotes `{query}` into a valid Elasticsearch DSL query.

- Fields must come from the provided mapping list. Do not use other fields.
- Only provide the JSON code portion of the answer. Compress the JSON output by removing whitespace.
- Do not add any extra backticks in your answer.
- The search should be case-insensitive.
- The search should support fuzzy matching.
- If fuzzy matching is added, do not add case insensitivity.
- Do not return fields containing vector data.

1. **Prompt Engineering Techniques and Resources**

- **Rich Examples**: Provide multiple examples to the model to guide its learning.
- **Clear Instructions**: Ensure instructions are clear and unambiguous.
- **Restrict Input and Output Formats**: Prevent users from inputting malicious content to protect model security.
